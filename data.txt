Help
The device list page shows all items of the LAN Host Discovery table. Use the "Clear and Rescan for Devices" button to reset the devices table and do a fresh search for connected LAN devices.

Allocation types include static and dhcp. When the allocation type of a device has not yet been determined, it is marked pending.
Devices that are powered off will continue to appear in the table, but be shown as "off" for a period of more than a day.
The Last Activity display will be blank if the WAN is down or the device cannot reach a time server.
